## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Install package in development mode
```

### Quick Start

```python
# Example usage will be added as research progresses
import causal_discovery_toolkit

# Initialize model
model = causal_discovery_toolkit.Model()

# Run inference
results = model.forward(data)
```
